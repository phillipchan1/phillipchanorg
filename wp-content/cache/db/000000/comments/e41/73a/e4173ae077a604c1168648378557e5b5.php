I think this is an important question as I'm thinking how our (American) culture is experiencing greater extensions of extended adolescence. Things that people in their 30's do today, people did in their 20's a generation ago. And things that people in their 20's do today, people did in their teens. These are things which include marriage, working, play, relational stability, etc..

The topic of becoming a man is one that is close to my heart because I'm one who is often remarked for my great spiritual maturity yet people are puzzled with my bouts of immaturity. I remember thinking to myself often, "Man, how do I get myself to grow up? I wish I was more mature."

This article is the summation of those reflections, and actually trying those things out.

I'm writing because I think that our generation is <em>suffering from the absence of strong men</em>. When I say strong men, I'm not meaning this American-constructed idea of manliness which the church has often adopted, where I'm big, climb mountains, have a beard, inconsiderate, independent, loud, like football, brash, rude, base...you get the picture. I'm concerned with issues in our character because I think that that is a greater measure of manly maturation.

I'm also writing because I see this also as dating advice for men. I think that women are looking for men to marry and date, not boys.

If you are a young man in your teens, 20's, 30's, looking for a rite of passage to manhood, or looking for ways to "grow up", here areÂ some ideas that have worked for me in helping me mature into the person I am today. I'm definitely not the "perfect man" but I hope these will help you in your journey.

Here we go, 5 ways to grow up to manhood:
<h3><strong>1. Having a strong vision for your life</strong></h3>
<strong></strong>I have heard that it was said that at the end of your life, the success of your life is not dependent on how many things you master, but it is <span class="highlight">what you choose to have master you.</span> It's what your gripped by which determines the course of your life. That, my fellow dudes, is what you call <em>having vision for your life.</em>

It is having a vision for who you are as a person, and realizing what God made you to do on earth in the 30 seconds also known as life which makes a man grow up.

If you lack vision for your life, you need what I call "a midlife crisis" right now. You need to imagine yourself dead and gone today, standing before the throne of God, giving an account for your life, and explaining to God what you strove after and are currently striving after. If you can, with every drop of blood within you, tell God that you are doing today what God made you to do, then you sir, have vision. But if you are unable do that, you are most likely suffering from lack of vision.

You see there's something that happens to men when they have vision.<em> It's called having priorities.</em>

When you have vision for your life, truly unimportant things in your life will begin to fall by the wayside. The first evidence of this in my life after I began developing vision for my life was that I completely stopped playing video games. It was fun, entertaining, enticing, blah, blah, blah, but I realized that couldn't stand myself at the end of my life realizing I wasted so much time, money, and energy on something that has no bearing for the significance of my life and the benefit of others. It was also the same time I stopped caring so much about professional sports and fantasy basketball. As a matter of fact, I don't even own a television.

What do you do that's unimportant and meaningless? I assure you that you will have a much different attitude about those things when you realize how precious your life is and the amazing things that God has called you to do.

You'll never be bored when you have vision; you'll only have fire.

Did I mention that being driven is a very attractive quality for a being a boyfriend or husband? <span class="highlight">Women need to know you're going somewhere because they want to know that you'll take them somewhere significant at the end of their life as well.</span>

First step for manlinessâ€“get vision.
<h3><strong>2. Taking responsibilities for your actions</strong></h3>
<strong></strong>If I could teach younger Phil one phrase that would have helped him in his maturation process earlier, I would have taught him what I'm about to teach you:
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"I take responsibility for that."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: left;">Go ahead, try it out. Say it a few times. Actually, get </span><em style="text-align: left;">really</em><span style="text-align: left;"> used to saying it because that will be one of the most helpful things that you will </span><em style="text-align: left;">ever</em><span style="text-align: left;"> learn how to say as a man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Learning to take responsibility of my actions was very important for me to grow up.</p>
Learning that my contributions to problems, ways I make mistakes, admitting those mistakes to necessary parties, and reflecting on what to do differently will make a world of a difference.

So here's my recommendation:

<em>If you're late for an event, take responsibility for it.</em>
<em> If you're delinquent on your payments, take responsibility for it.</em>
<em> If you're pissing people off, take responsibility for it.</em>
<em> If you're in the wrong, don't roll your eyes, don't complain, don't run away, don't make excuses, take responsibility for it.</em>

Being faithful with little will yield to being faithful with much. And part of being faithful is recognizing ways we haven't been faithful. It teaches us that our actions have consequences. And by being a person who recognizes and values the consequences of our actions, <em>we become trustworthy people</em>, both in God's eyes and in people's eyes.

Second step for manlinessâ€“taking responsibilities for your actions.
<h3><strong>3. Not Being a Lone RangerÂ </strong></h3>
<strong></strong>One of the biggest misconceptions about what it means to be a man is this idea of being a lone-ranger. My two thoughts?

Unbiblical and unhealthy.

Being a man is about having relational maturity. It is about learning to love, like, and get along with people different (and similar) than you are. A healthy man is one who is surrounded with healthy relationships which act as a fortress for his being. We were made for deep relationships, both with other men, and healthy platonic (read: non-sexual) friendships with women.

Some thoughts on cultivating deep relationships:

It means having the <strong>courage</strong> to initiate conflict resolution and having the <strong>wisdom</strong> to communicate clearly and generously. It means having the <strong>adventuring spirit</strong> to know another person deeply. It means having the <strong>humility</strong> to not compete against others.

I think what's modeled as what men do are: pridefulness, conflict-avoidant nature, passive-aggressiveness, rudeness, and loneliness.

I think what Jesus (as the best model of manliness in the universe) emulated was humility, reconciliation, gracious confrontations (except when fighting evil!), and living in community.

Third step for manlinessâ€“be in community and have deep relationships.
<h3><strong>4. Embracing the Brokenness of Your Being</strong></h3>
<strong></strong>One of the biggest things I've faced as a man is facing my inadequacies. There's a reason why men don't open up easilyâ€“whether we know it or not,<em> we are desperately sensitive and defensive about the frailty of our being.Â </em>

We make that up by being funny, by being sarcastic, by going to the gym and hiding our insecurities, by watching pornography, by shutting down and stone-facing difficult times, by putting down others, and a plethora of other ways we build a wall around us to keep people from looking in on the inside of us.

Speaking from personal experience, seeing the last few months have been excruciatingly difficult coming to grips with my addictive behaviors, there's something so demoralizing about looking at the mirror of your soul and wondering if anyone will accept you for the weak, wicked, and broken person that you are.

And that's where Christ meets us.

We are met in the brokenness of our being, our vices, our imperfections, our weaknesses, and when we come to the place where we encounter God and receive his <em>massive grace</em> for our frailty, it will set our hearts free from needing to flaunt our strength.

You will stand up naked as you really are (not as clothed as you desire to be) and feel like the freest man on earth because<span class="highlight"> you realize that it is not our strength which gives us value, but it is God's strength which gives us value.Â </span>

It is not how great we are which makes us men,<em> it is how great God's love for us which makes us men.</em>

And we as men, as strong as we are, will become even stronger men when we embrace how weak we are. And God will get the glory for it.
<h3><strong>5. By Letting God be Your Heavenly Dad</strong></h3>
<strong></strong>In John Eldredge's <em>Wild at Heart</em>, he proposes that many men don't feel like men because they've never received the affirmation from their own dads about what it meant to be a man. I find his observations to be true, especially from my own life.

Like many, I've had my fair share of experiences of an absentee father who had his own brokenness he didn't know how to deal with. I know people with great dads, and worse dads, but one thing I know for sureâ€“<em>all dads fail to do what Daddy God does.</em>

Part of my personal testimony has been the story that God has adopted me as his son and he is my heavenly father in every sense of the word. In ways my earthly dad failed to teach me about life, about how to treat women, how to be a person of character, how to be a person of purpose, how to fish, how to love people, my heavenly Father taught me faithfully and wisely.

When I tell people "I am God's son," I dead-seriously mean it. And for me to come with that revelation is very healing in my journey towards adulthood.

It's when you lie down on your bed, gaze heavenward and hear your heavenly Father whisper to you how great you are, how precious you are in His sight, how he created you with purpose and delight, how you're not a failure, and how he loves you unconditionally and infinitely more than you can imagineâ€“that, my fellow dudes, is when you become a man.

As I've said before, it's not how great we are that makes us men, it's how great we are loved. And that is all done when we let God be the dad we've always been looking for.

----
Those are the ways that I've learned, in my journey towards manhood, which have helped me grow and mature as a man.

I hope and pray that they will be life to you.

I'm writing this post to explain a phenomenon that I used to detest as a younger Christian, yet strangely enough, am personally experiencing myself more and more of. As I am growing in my faith, I don't see this trend going in the opposite direction, and so now at this point, I am begging for some theological and biblical reflection on this phenomenon.

<span class="highlight">ThisÂ phenomenonÂ is none other than being drunk in the Holy Spirit.Â </span>

I'm writing this because I feel that I have two audiences reading; both of which I want to explain what I've learned as well as learn from.

First are my non-charismatic / conservative / Reformed / curious friends who will have responses to this phenomenon which range from "This is unbiblical", "This is pointless", "I don't have experience of this", "This is honestly really weird", to "I'm actually a bit curious about it." Yes I have you in mind as I write because I care about you and want to defend not only mine and many other Christians' experiences, but show that there is good biblical precedence for this phenomenon. Also I want to learn from you and hear your thoughts about this.

Second are my super charismatic / pentecostal friends. While I have ecstatic experiences in the Holy Spirit, I admit not as much as you guys. So I want to hear your mystical experiences and spiritual insights into this.

So here's my biblical and theological reflection on why some Christians roll around the floor laughing Â with joy. Enjoy.

&nbsp;
<h2>Biblical Precedence for Spiritual Drunkenness</h2>
Yes, I am being drunk in the Holy SpiritÂ <em>andÂ </em>am a Bible-believing Christian. What are the odds? I want to show some passages in the scriptures which inform my understanding of being drunk in the Spirit.

<strong>Acts 2:1-13 - Pentecost</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"But others mocking said, 'They are filled with new wine.'"Â </em></p>
The first place I want to look is Acts on the day of Pentecost. The Holy Spirit is prophetically poured out powerfully on the believers at the time. What happens is that "they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance." Furthermore, the crowd gathers around them and mocks them first with amazement. But the second observation they note is striking to me.

It says, "Others mocked them saying, 'They are filled with new wine'" (2:13). Even Peter would later respond to this accusation by saying "These are people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day" (2:15).

What an interesting way to describe the filling of the Holy Spirit, that the apostles were "drunk". When you think of a group of people being drunk, even across different cultures, I think you can imagine the same sceneâ€“probably a boisterous, tipsy, and chaotic scene. I can imagine them falling over, being a little light headed, and laughing, intoxicated with the influence of the wine.

The reason I think this is the case is because the accusation of being drunk doesn't satisfy men simply standing there speaking in other human languages, because that's quite a normal activity that happens (even though it was supernaturally given to them). This description given in Acts reveals a more chaotic scene as the influencing power of the Holy Spirit is on them.

In short, I think the scene in Acts is one of men and women who are filled with the Spirit, and being drunk in His presence. This intoxicating presence leads them to speak in other languages declaring God's praises, and leads to the possibility of other activities fit for the description of being drunk e.g. being tipsy, light-headed, falling over, laughing excessively.

<strong>Ephesians 5:18</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Â And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit.</em></p>
We enter further into the New Testament, which I argue has a very robust and pervasive theology of the Holy Spirit. In Ephesians, Paul comments on being filled with the Spirit and contrasts it with "being drunk with wine."

The comparison is meant to show that there is a both strong connection and difference between being intoxicated with wine and being intoxicated with the Holy Spirit. The similarity, by nature of the metaphor, is that both are powerful controlling substances/agents.

When alcohol enters our system it leads us to a number of things e.g. lowering of inhibition, fake friendliness, fake happiness, laughing at things, lower bodily control. These usually only bring us to bad places because people do stupid things when they're drunk.

When the Spirit is filling us, I think it leads to many of those things like alcohol, except in the opposite direction. Lowering of inhibition leads to boldness for Jesus, friendliness and supernatural joy, laughing at things (because God is quite funny), and lowering bodily control (an inherent quality of controlling substances).

When people are filled with the Spirit, they do great things they will exhibit the fruit of the Spirit. But what I'm highlighting here is theÂ phenomenologicalÂ similarities between being drunk in the Spirit and being drunk with wine.

<strong>1 Samuel 19 - Saul Prophesying with the Prophets</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied...</em></p>
A study on the Spirit in the Bible will eventually lead you to a study of the Spirit in the Old Testament, as its presence is quite frequent. Of the many, I will highlight just one.

This is actually both a hilarious and powerful scene.

Saul is chasing David to kill him. And then out of nowhere the text says, "the Spirit of God falls on Saul's messengers and they started prophesying." There was a suddenÂ <em>interruptionÂ </em>of their course of action as the Spirit fell on them. They couldn't chase David anymore because the Spirit of God was on them. It wasn't just a mental shift like "Oh I'm going to stop chasing David now", but they were physically arrested by the Spirit of God which led them to prophesy uncontrollably.

Most people won't believe it but the text will go on later to say that Saul would be hit and filled with the Spirit of God and, I quote, "he too prophesied before Samuel and <em>lay naked all that day and all that night</em>" (19:24).

What a strange yet powerful image of the Holy Spirit.

I bring this to show that the Spirit has power in him which leads to real physical effects on the human person as witnessed by the people in the Bible who were filled with him.

&nbsp;
<h2>Spiritual &amp; Theological Reflections</h2>
<strong>My Experience of Being Drunk in the Spirit</strong>

Experience doesn't teach everything but it does inform our theology more than we give it credit for, so allow me to share my personal experiences.

I've come to a point in my faith when I can recognize the move of the Spirit on my life. I can tell when he's deeply wounded by my actions, when he's ecstatic by my presence, when he's just enjoying our conversation, or when he's filling me with spiritual power for a ministry task.

In addition, the Christian life is about making a proper resting place for Jesus to dwell and move in us. So as I am growing and Jesus is having more of my heart, there is more room for his presence to dwell in me.

With that, my experiences of encountering God over the years become increasingly intense, and I have a handful of powerful ecstatic experiences which only a few people know about. But lately, being filled in the Spirit to a point where I am just sitting there chuckling or falling over completely bawling with uncontrollable laughter has been an increasing occurrence.

What happens to me during that time? Well, for sure, I feel the joy of the Lord. Joy is not something you can fake. There's a real sense where the joy of God's presence (Ps 16:11) is manifested in that moment.<span class="highlight"> All my worries that I was presently thinking about are suddenly put into perspective of being in the presence of an overly joyous God.</span> His joy wells up inside me and I can't help but just laugh because my troubles are so silly. He loves me like crazy.

It's like God is tickling me and revelation is just flowing. I see and hear thoughts constantly; I literally want to write and tweet them out all the time. I will want to spontaneously dance and worship God, which I often will do. His presence on me is so strong with divine happiness and I will start praying in tongues.

I've been drunk in front of my roommates before and they thought it was a very strange sight. That's fineâ€“I think it's strange when people are drunk on wine. When I'm filled with God's presence I am completely in another universe, the universe of God's love.

<strong>The Phenomenon of the Living God inside of Us</strong>

To the concern of there being aÂ phenomenological result at all when the Spirit of God comes on us, my concerns are actually opposite. My concern is when the living God of the universe enters a frail finite human frame, why isn't there an evenÂ <em>greater phenomenological response?</em>

Why aren't we all blowing up with the amount of energy which exists in the Triune God dwelling inside of us? The fact that people, when filled with the Spirit of God, are falling over, shaking, or laughing uncontrollably seems almost like a small thing.

To understand the phenomenon of being drunk in the Spirit, we have to come to understanding that God touches us not just in a "spiritual" way, but in a real physical way. I think this is the point of the biblical passages I brought forward. His presence is not just a force or a feeling, but it is the person of Jesus, with all his emotions and power dwelling inside our weak and frail bodies.

<strong>Drunkenness as Operating From an Alternate Universe</strong>

It is known that Jesus' entire ministry is based on this: "Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing" (John 5:19). He does everything because he sees his Father in heaven doing it.

It's out of this that Jesus spends precious time praying alone with Father. His time with God completely dominated his life and informed his ministry. He did everything out of being connected with God.

It is out of this which led him to do things that no one else thought was plausible. He waited an additional 2 days to heal Lazarus; he went into Jerusalem despite people wanting to kill him; he fed 5000 people with a few loaves and fish despite his disciples' insistence. He simply saw things differently. It was as if he was operating from an alternative universe. Yes, it is the universe of his Father's world.

Being drunk in the Spirit is like that. When the Spirit of God is on you in a powerful way, you have access to the heavenlies like never before. You being operating out of the presence of God residing in you. It's quite a humorous and exciting experience when you are laughing with joy because God's Spirit is on you in the midst of a context which is so depressed. It's much better to operate out of divine joy than to operate out of the depressing spiritual environment you are in.

<strong>Being Drunk with Others</strong>

I remember a time when I went to Bethel Church in Redding (the church where Jesus Culture comes out of and where Bill Johnson teaches), everyone was getting drunk in the SpiritÂ <em>all the time</em>. People were in classrooms falling over with laughter and joy, and it led to them having supernatural faith (which I believe is why they see so many miracles in their church). It was quite an experience, to say the least.

I've had a few of those experiences before. There are times when the Spirit of God falls on a group of people and then they suddenly start losing it. I remember just looking at someone else who is shaking, falling, and laughing, and in that moment, all I could think of was Psalm 34 where it says, "Taste and see that the Lord is good."

We were just so happy and we were enjoying together in our senses that the God who inhabits and surrounds us indeedÂ <em>tastes good</em>. He tastes so good it we just laughed at how good his presence felt on us.

<strong>Historical Precedence</strong>

I am actually not very well researched in this area, but I want to bring a resource I found from Mike Bickle who found in his research that spiritual manifestations were very common throughout heightened spiritual activity in the church, even the Great Awakenings in American religious history.

The PDF can be found <a href="http://www.mikebickle.org.edgesuite.net/MikeBickleVOD/2009/20091228_The_Manifestations_of_the_Spirit_in_Church_History.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>

His PDF also has some great insights that I won't touch on concerning manifestations in the Spirit.

<strong>Common Objections</strong>

I want to briefly comment on some common objections I hear.

<em>"The Holy Spirit should yield the fruit of the Spirit, not this."</em> - True. I love the fruit of the Spirit and how the Spirit teaches and empowers us to live lives of character. But this endeavor is not opposed to being drunk in his presence and the fruit of the Spirit does not sum up the entirety of the NT's teaching about the expectation for the Spirit.

<em>"The church should have order (1 Cor 14) and being drunk is wildness"</em> â€“ True, the church should have order. Two comments. First, order is contextual and relative. What is "orderly" is different in a white middle class congregation and a Indonesian church. Second, I think the concern in 1 Cor 14 is Paul trying to order the usage of spiritual gifts so that they are working in unity, hence "For God is not a God of confusion but of peace" (1 Cor 14:33).

<em>"It's just really weird."</em> â€“ I'll give you that. But I will posit two things. First, I find that the people who find it most weird are influenced more by American philosophy of naturalismÂ (which often denies spiritual reality / prioritizes intellectualism) than biblical reality of real spiritual presences influencing human behavior. The biblical world is rife with spiritualism and ecstatic experiences. Second, there's a strong connection between the Book of Acts Church in them being filled with the Spirit and the power of the church. <em>Considering how powerless our churches are, perhaps it is not the drunk who are weird, but those aren't are</em> (I say this not as an indictment, but just to bring a shift in perspective).

<strong>What's the Point of Being Drunk?</strong>

The point of being drunk is connected with experiencing God. Yes, I am making a point that being drunk on the Spirit should yield great results. But I think the important thing, which I think most people who oppose it don't quite get is that, encountering God is an ends in itself.

When we're drunk in the Spirit, we are literally filled with God's presence, for all his joy, his mystery, his power, and it is anÂ <em>amazing feeling and experience</em>.

I mean, you are encountering the God of the universe in a real manifest way. And itÂ <em>should</em> lead you to live a holier, more loving life, which is a goal. <span class="highlight">But if the gospel is about a relationship with God, then anytime we encounter God, it is a holy ends in itself.Â </span>

And being drunk in the Spirit is a very real way of encountering God.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
I hope that these thoughts are helpful in helping us think about the phenomenon known as being drunk in the Holy Spirit.

I hope to share more thoughts in the future as I grow experientially, theologically, and spiritually on this subject.

With that being said, I welcome any thoughts or criticisms.

It is really natural to look at someone and go "Wow, he or she is really impressive!" It is equally tempting, in our human nature, to begin crowning giftedness. We can say things to these people like:

<em>"You should be, like, in charge of things."Â </em>
<em>"You should start your own x,y,z and promote yourself."</em>
<em>"You should be promoted and display your talents!"</em>

On the receiving side, talented people often suffer from thinking they can get ahead of life because of their talents. When humans value giftedness so much, who can blame them?

I have to admit, I think I'm pretty talented. And that's something that people tell me pretty oftenâ€“I can do a lot of things well. Surprisingly well (Do I write well? Eh...). And God knows all the things I do well and excel in.

In life, I run into a lot of talented people.Â <em>Amazingly</em> talented people. In fact, you could be one of those people reading now. And it is my prediction that with the pervasive growth of technology, the proliferation of information at our fingertips (quite literally), we may soon experience one of the most talented generations in human history.

Yet, the shocking thing is that the more I read the Bible the more I am knowing the heart of God. And what I'm realizing is that, <em><strong>despite what we think is really great about being talented or gifted, I don't think God values giftedness very much at all.</strong></em>

Allow me to explain what I mean.

The one passage that continually informs my understanding of the folly of giftedness is 1 Samuel 16:7. In this passage, Samuel is selecting a new king for Israel and makes the fatal mistake of thinking that God would choose the most physically impressive.Â God rebukes his prophet Samuel with one of the most amazing passages in the entire Bible. He says to Samuel:

<em>"Do not look at his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him.Â </em>
<em>For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but the Lord looks on the heart.</span>"</em>

What we find impressive about ourselves or other people, God is...not even looking at that.

While we as humans are impressed by people's skills, their intelligence, their creativity, their great works of arts and achievement, their portfolio, their abilities, their athleticism, their innate qualities, etc,Â <em>God</em> is not impressed by <em>any</em> of those things. <strong>God is looking dead straight...at our hearts.</strong>

He's seeing what we're made of on the inside. The human heart is what is valuable and beautiful to God.

What is valued by the God of the universe is how we are positioned before God. It's about how we treat other people. It's about how we deal with conflict. It's how we parent our kids. It's how we cherish our spouses. It's about the moral purity of our ways. It's about how we treat the poor and oppressed. It's how we spend our time and our money. It's how we respond to our enemies, to the people who annoy us, to the ones who don't like. It's about what we do with our pride. It's how we respond to authority. It's how cynical or offended we are. <em>It's all about who we are when no one's looking, when no one's impressed, when no one cares.Â </em>

Talent and giftedness are grossly overrated because they have been vastly outweighed by what God values moreâ€“<strong><em>our character.</em></strong>

Have you ever noticed that Jesus never talks about talented people or gifted people? When he incarnated on earth, he spent no time with talented or great people. His affections were with lowly, poor, humble, and mistreated people, not promoted talented people.

Think also for a minuteâ€“Jesus is definitively the most talented human being in human history. He could have shown up and showed up every human being in history in every single category of human achievement. Hands down he could have. But He, in his humility, and in his conviction about what his Father valued, never flaunted his gifts. He did not flex his muscles of giftedness. He lived an opposite message.

He said that "whoever should be great, must be your servant." In addition, he said that the great ones are those are exhibit humble child-likeness (Mt 18). The greatest people in Jesus' eyes are the humble, the meek, and the child-like.

The only time he does talk about talent is when he's teaching the parable of the talents. In that parable, he makes no distinction between the one he gave five talents or ten talents. They both received the reward of hearing the Master say, "Well done, good and faithful servant." His message was <em>faithfulness</em> with our talents, no matter how many we've been given is what moves God's heart. Yet again, another challenge to our character.

Yes, it turns out that giftedness isn't that great after all.

1 Corinthians 12:6 talks about how allÂ gifts, be it natural or spiritual, are given by God. And if they're given by God, there's no point in boasting or placing value on ourselves because of them.

Furthermore, gifts, according to the New Testament, are simply used toÂ <em>serve</em> other people. It is to makeÂ <em>other</em> people great. In a world of rabid and diseased self-promotion, the Bible powerfully challenges us to use our giftedness, not for the fame for our own names, but to promote and serve other people. Amazing.

If you are indeed one of those very talented people (even if you are aren't, this still applies to you!), perhaps we should put our talents in perspective with what's importantâ€“our character before a holy God.

<em>What good is it if you can sing brilliantly if you fail to love others? What good is it if you can rap and write poetry if you're addicted to pornography and lust? What good is it if you're the top dog at work when you lash out at your wife at home? What good is it if your works of art are publicized widely when you have uncontrollable rage? What good is it if you are super intelligent when you look down on others?</em>

Over and over again, God has humbled me and has tried to make my giftedness second place to the quality of my heart. It is at this point that I humbly plead with you and at the same time joyfully invite all you talented people...

...partner with God to work on your character, and you will find that your talents and giftedness will be seated in the proper context. The proper context is a heart refined and designed for humble service towards others and life lived for a great God.

Talents? Gifts? <em>Lord, instead give me more a heart like yours.</em>

I'm writing this post to explain a phenomenon that I used to detest as a younger Christian, yet strangely enough, am personally experiencing myself more and more of. As I am growing in my faith, I don't see this trend going in the opposite direction, and so now at this point, I am begging for some theological and biblical reflection on this phenomenon.

<span class="highlight">ThisÂ phenomenonÂ is none other than being drunk in the Holy Spirit.Â </span>

I'm writing this because I feel that I have two audiences reading; both of which I want to explain what I've learned as well as learn from.

First are my non-charismatic / conservative / Reformed / curious friends who will have responses to this phenomenon which range from "This is unbiblical", "This is pointless", "I don't have experience of this", "This is honestly really weird", to "I'm actually a bit curious about it." Yes I have you in mind as I write because I care about you and want to defend not only mine and many other Christians' experiences, but show that there is good biblical precedence for this phenomenon. Also I want to learn from you and hear your thoughts about this.

Second are my super charismatic / pentecostal friends. While I have ecstatic experiences in the Holy Spirit, I admit not as much as you guys. So I want to hear your mystical experiences and spiritual insights into this.

So here's my biblical and theological reflection on why some Christians roll around the floor laughing Â with joy. Enjoy.

&nbsp;
<h2>Biblical Precedence for Spiritual Drunkenness</h2>
Yes, I am being drunk in the Holy SpiritÂ <em>andÂ </em>am a Bible-believing Christian. What are the odds? I want to show some passages in the scriptures which inform my understanding of being drunk in the Spirit.

<strong>Acts 2:1-13 - Pentecost</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"But others mocking said, 'They are filled with new wine.'"Â </em></p>
The first place I want to look is Acts on the day of Pentecost. The Holy Spirit is prophetically poured out powerfully on the believers at the time. What happens is that "they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance." Furthermore, the crowd gathers around them and mocks them first with amazement. But the second observation they note is striking to me.

It says, "Others mocked them saying, 'They are filled with new wine'" (2:13). Even Peter would later respond to this accusation by saying "These are people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day" (2:15).

What an interesting way to describe the filling of the Holy Spirit, that the apostles were "drunk". When you think of a group of people being drunk, even across different cultures, I think you can imagine the same sceneâ€“probably a boisterous, tipsy, and chaotic scene. I can imagine them falling over, being a little light headed, and laughing, intoxicated with the influence of the wine.

The reason I think this is the case is because the accusation of being drunk doesn't satisfy men simply standing there speaking in other human languages, because that's quite a normal activity that happens (even though it was supernaturally given to them). This description given in Acts reveals a more chaotic scene as the influencing power of the Holy Spirit is on them.

In short, I think the scene in Acts is one of men and women who are filled with the Spirit, and being drunk in His presence. This intoxicating presence leads them to speak in other languages declaring God's praises, and leads to the possibility of other activities fit for the description of being drunk e.g. being tipsy, light-headed, falling over, laughing excessively.

<strong>Ephesians 5:18</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Â And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit.</em></p>
We enter further into the New Testament, which I argue has a very robust and pervasive theology of the Holy Spirit. In Ephesians, Paul comments on being filled with the Spirit and contrasts it with "being drunk with wine."

The comparison is meant to show that there is a both strong connection and difference between being intoxicated with wine and being intoxicated with the Holy Spirit. The similarity, by nature of the metaphor, is that both are powerful controlling substances/agents.

When alcohol enters our system it leads us to a number of things e.g. lowering of inhibition, fake friendliness, fake happiness, laughing at things, lower bodily control. These usually only bring us to bad places because people do stupid things when they're drunk.

When the Spirit is filling us, I think it leads to many of those things like alcohol, except in the opposite direction. Lowering of inhibition leads to boldness for Jesus, friendliness and supernatural joy, laughing at things (because God is quite funny), and lowering bodily control (an inherent quality of controlling substances).

When people are filled with the Spirit, they do great things they will exhibit the fruit of the Spirit. But what I'm highlighting here is theÂ phenomenologicalÂ similarities between being drunk in the Spirit and being drunk with wine.

<strong>1 Samuel 19 - Saul Prophesying with the Prophets</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied...</em></p>
A study on the Spirit in the Bible will eventually lead you to a study of the Spirit in the Old Testament, as its presence is quite frequent. Of the many, I will highlight just one.

This is actually both a hilarious and powerful scene.

Saul is chasing David to kill him. And then out of nowhere the text says, "the Spirit of God falls on Saul's messengers and they started prophesying." There was a suddenÂ <em>interruptionÂ </em>of their course of action as the Spirit fell on them. They couldn't chase David anymore because the Spirit of God was on them. It wasn't just a mental shift like "Oh I'm going to stop chasing David now", but they were physically arrested by the Spirit of God which led them to prophesy uncontrollably.

Most people won't believe it but the text will go on later to say that Saul would be hit and filled with the Spirit of God and, I quote, "he too prophesied before Samuel and <em>lay naked all that day and all that night</em>" (19:24).

What a strange yet powerful image of the Holy Spirit.

I bring this to show that the Spirit has power in him which leads to real physical effects on the human person as witnessed by the people in the Bible who were filled with him.

&nbsp;
<h2>Spiritual &amp; Theological Reflections</h2>
<strong>My Experience of Being Drunk in the Spirit</strong>

Experience doesn't teach everything but it does inform our theology more than we give it credit for, so allow me to share my personal experiences.

I've come to a point in my faith when I can recognize the move of the Spirit on my life. I can tell when he's deeply wounded by my actions, when he's ecstatic by my presence, when he's just enjoying our conversation, or when he's filling me with spiritual power for a ministry task.

In addition, the Christian life is about making a proper resting place for Jesus to dwell and move in us. So as I am growing and Jesus is having more of my heart, there is more room for his presence to dwell in me.

With that, my experiences of encountering God over the years become increasingly intense, and I have a handful of powerful ecstatic experiences which only a few people know about. But lately, being filled in the Spirit to a point where I am just sitting there chuckling or falling over completely bawling with uncontrollable laughter has been an increasing occurrence.

What happens to me during that time? Well, for sure, I feel the joy of the Lord. Joy is not something you can fake. There's a real sense where the joy of God's presence (Ps 16:11) is manifested in that moment.<span class="highlight"> All my worries that I was presently thinking about are suddenly put into perspective of being in the presence of an overly joyous God.</span> His joy wells up inside me and I can't help but just laugh because my troubles are so silly. He loves me like crazy.

It's like God is tickling me and revelation is just flowing. I see and hear thoughts constantly; I literally want to write and tweet them out all the time. I will want to spontaneously dance and worship God, which I often will do. His presence on me is so strong with divine happiness and I will start praying in tongues.

I've been drunk in front of my roommates before and they thought it was a very strange sight. That's fineâ€“I think it's strange when people are drunk on wine. When I'm filled with God's presence I am completely in another universe, the universe of God's love.

<strong>The Phenomenon of the Living God inside of Us</strong>

To the concern of there being aÂ phenomenological result at all when the Spirit of God comes on us, my concerns are actually opposite. My concern is when the living God of the universe enters a frail finite human frame, why isn't there an evenÂ <em>greater phenomenological response?</em>

Why aren't we all blowing up with the amount of energy which exists in the Triune God dwelling inside of us? The fact that people, when filled with the Spirit of God, are falling over, shaking, or laughing uncontrollably seems almost like a small thing.

To understand the phenomenon of being drunk in the Spirit, we have to come to understanding that God touches us not just in a "spiritual" way, but in a real physical way. I think this is the point of the biblical passages I brought forward. His presence is not just a force or a feeling, but it is the person of Jesus, with all his emotions and power dwelling inside our weak and frail bodies.

<strong>Drunkenness as Operating From an Alternate Universe</strong>

It is known that Jesus' entire ministry is based on this: "Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing" (John 5:19). He does everything because he sees his Father in heaven doing it.

It's out of this that Jesus spends precious time praying alone with Father. His time with God completely dominated his life and informed his ministry. He did everything out of being connected with God.

It is out of this which led him to do things that no one else thought was plausible. He waited an additional 2 days to heal Lazarus; he went into Jerusalem despite people wanting to kill him; he fed 5000 people with a few loaves and fish despite his disciples' insistence. He simply saw things differently. It was as if he was operating from an alternative universe. Yes, it is the universe of his Father's world.

Being drunk in the Spirit is like that. When the Spirit of God is on you in a powerful way, you have access to the heavenlies like never before. You being operating out of the presence of God residing in you. It's quite a humorous and exciting experience when you are laughing with joy because God's Spirit is on you in the midst of a context which is so depressed. It's much better to operate out of divine joy than to operate out of the depressing spiritual environment you are in.

<strong>Being Drunk with Others</strong>

I remember a time when I went to Bethel Church in Redding (the church where Jesus Culture comes out of and where Bill Johnson teaches), everyone was getting drunk in the SpiritÂ <em>all the time</em>. People were in classrooms falling over with laughter and joy, and it led to them having supernatural faith (which I believe is why they see so many miracles in their church). It was quite an experience, to say the least.

I've had a few of those experiences before. There are times when the Spirit of God falls on a group of people and then they suddenly start losing it. I remember just looking at someone else who is shaking, falling, and laughing, and in that moment, all I could think of was Psalm 34 where it says, "Taste and see that the Lord is good."

We were just so happy and we were enjoying together in our senses that the God who inhabits and surrounds us indeedÂ <em>tastes good</em>. He tastes so good it we just laughed at how good his presence felt on us.

<strong>Historical Precedence</strong>

I am actually not very well researched in this area, but I want to bring a resource I found from Mike Bickle who found in his research that spiritual manifestations were very common throughout heightened spiritual activity in the church, even the Great Awakenings in American religious history.

The PDF can be found <a href="http://www.mikebickle.org.edgesuite.net/MikeBickleVOD/2009/20091228_The_Manifestations_of_the_Spirit_in_Church_History.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>

His PDF also has some great insights that I won't touch on concerning manifestations in the Spirit.

<strong>Common Objections</strong>

I want to briefly comment on some common objections I hear.

<em>"The Holy Spirit should yield the fruit of the Spirit, not this."</em> - True. I love the fruit of the Spirit and how the Spirit teaches and empowers us to live lives of character. But this endeavor is not opposed to being drunk in his presence and the fruit of the Spirit does not sum up the entirety of the NT's teaching about the expectation for the Spirit.

<em>"The church should have order (1 Cor 14) and being drunk is wildness"</em> â€“ True, the church should have order. Two comments. First, order is contextual and relative. What is "orderly" is different in a white middle class congregation and a Indonesian church. Second, I think the concern in 1 Cor 14 is Paul trying to order the usage of spiritual gifts so that they are working in unity, hence "For God is not a God of confusion but of peace" (1 Cor 14:33).

<em>"It's just really weird."</em> â€“ I'll give you that. But I will posit two things. First, I find that the people who find it most weird are influenced more by American philosophy of naturalismÂ (which often denies spiritual reality / prioritizes intellectualism) than biblical reality of real spiritual presences influencing human behavior. The biblical world is rife with spiritualism and ecstatic experiences. Second, there's a strong connection between the Book of Acts Church in them being filled with the Spirit and the power of the church. <em>Considering how powerless our churches are, perhaps it is not the drunk who are weird, but those aren't are</em> (I say this not as an indictment, but just to bring a shift in perspective).

<strong>What's the Point of Being Drunk?</strong>

The point of being drunk is connected with experiencing God. Yes, I am making a point that being drunk on the Spirit should yield great results. But I think the important thing, which I think most people who oppose it don't quite get is that, encountering God is an ends in itself.

When we're drunk in the Spirit, we are literally filled with God's presence, for all his joy, his mystery, his power, and it is anÂ <em>amazing feeling and experience</em>.

I mean, you are encountering the God of the universe in a real manifest way. And itÂ <em>should</em> lead you to live a holier, more loving life, which is a goal. <span class="highlight">But if the gospel is about a relationship with God, then anytime we encounter God, it is a holy ends in itself.Â </span>

And being drunk in the Spirit is a very real way of encountering God.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
I hope that these thoughts are helpful in helping us think about the phenomenon known as being drunk in the Holy Spirit.

I hope to share more thoughts in the future as I grow experientially, theologically, and spiritually on this subject.

With that being said, I welcome any thoughts or criticisms.
