"Strictly AutoTags is a plugin that scans an English language post for words that could be used as tags and then orders them so that the most relevant\n"
"words get added against the post. Just because a word appears in a post that is already in your list of tags does not mean that it should\n"
"automatically be added against the article. Therefore the plugin orders all matching tags in descending order and picks only those that occur the most."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid ""
"As well as using existing tags to work out which words to tag posts with this plugin automatically detects new words to use as tags \n"
"by using a simple rule of thumb I have discovered during my time using Wordpress as a blogging tool. I have found that over 90% of all\n"
"tags I use fall into one of the following three categories: Acronyms e.g CIA, FBI, AIG, IT, SQL, ASP, names of people or places and countries.\n"
"Therefore using the power of regular expressions I scan posts for words or sentences that match these three groups and then store them\n"
"as potential tag candidates."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid ""
"The more posts are added to a blog the more tags will get added but the good thing about this plugin is that having no existing tags \n"
"stored in your Wordpress DB isn't a bar from using it as it will auto detect suitable tags whenever it comes across them."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid ""
"Whereas other tag plugins only detect a single occurance of a tag this plugin will search for the most used tags within the content so that \n"
"only relevant tags get added. If you set the MaxTags option to 5 then it will pick the top 5 occurring tags within the post and ignore all others.\n"
"The RankTitle option when set means that tags found in the post title are automatically added to the post even if they only occur once and only within\n"
"the title."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid ""
"This plugin is not a replacement for other tag related plugims such as Smart Tags as it doesn't even try to manage the tags within your blog.\n"
"The plugin is designed to do one thing and one thing only which is to add the most relevant and appropriate tags to your posts as well as discovering new\n"
