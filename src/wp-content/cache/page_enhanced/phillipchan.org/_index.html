			<h2>Keeping my Heart Alive</h2>
<p>Working full-time has its difficulties. One of the bigger challenges I constantly face is being an on-fire believer of Jesus while working full-time.</p>
<p>I think people are aware of the challenges.. The amount of time you actually have to do things is limited, not to mention you&#8217;re constantly tired, work is mentally exhausting and challenging, the amount of people you see is very limiting, and the workplace is probably not a conducive place for a vibrant relationship with Jesus.</p>
<p>I remember a few months ago I was frustrated with the way my relationship with God was going. In exasperation, I lamented to my wife, &#8220;My life is not sustainable! If I didn&#8217;t have certain meetings throughout the week at church, my spiritual life would be in decay!&#8221;</p>
<p>I hate the feeling of my love growing cold towards God. And not having the power in the Spirit I need to not just survive but thrive.</p>
<p>Lately, God has been teaching me ways of how to be working full-time <em>and</em> being on fire for God. I am sitting at my cubicle these days singing praises to Jesus because God&#8217;s Spirit is on me. And getting to that point required some changes.</p>
<p>Here are some things I learned that have been helping me.</p>
<p><strong>1. Removing endless distractions clears my heart for God</strong></p>
<p>God spoke something profound to me on my birthday. He said to me, <em>&#8220;The rage of the world is to get people distracted with meaningless pursuits.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m married, I think about a typical American adult lifestyle, and the expectations of what people my age usually do. I have found that most of it to be one big huge distraction from eternal things.</p>
<p>Esther and I prayed and talked for a while about whether to get a TV given that we have some gift cards. We resolved that we were not going to get a TV to watch TV. I know the temptation of coming home from work and just clocking out in front of the &#8220;big distraction.&#8221;</p>
<p>That activity that a lot of American men engage in is just an escape for the day&#8217;s work. It wastes valuable time and heart space to engage with God after work. As of now, all we do with our TV is mostly stream IHOP&#8217;s prayer room to cultivate an atmosphere of worship and prayer in our house.</p>
<p>This process for us comes out of a recognition of a bigger observation that I&#8217;ve been noting.</p>
<p><em>As entertainment and media is increasingly a bigger part of our global technological culture, I have found that most Jesus-followers have opted to just be increasing consumers of it all without really assessing what it does to their spirits.</em></p>
<p>Not to say my experience is representative of every person, but I have found that entertainment, for the most part, dulls my spirit and sensitivity towards God. It distracts me from dealing with heart issues. It easier to put something onto a screen rather than to process my hard day at work with the Lord.</p>
<p>And it is in the media distribution&#8217;s mentality, the smart phone market&#8217;s mentality, and every up and coming media outlet&#8217;s mentality to to make addictive media more and more accessible to people. They put it in their phones, they make it stream, they load you with options, it&#8217;s all geared to get us to be hooked and distracted.</p>
<p>And so I am making clear decisions of not engaging in meaningless distractions. I want all my activities that my wife and I do to be intentional.</p>
<p><em><strong>We have to be intentional about how we feed our hearts because I want to determine what kind of heart I want to have before God.</strong></em> Do I want a dull and entertained heart/mind? Or do I want a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">burning</span> one for Jesus?</p>
<p>The answer to that question lies in what activities I choose. And because I&#8217;m increasingly saying &#8220;no&#8221; to typical American choices of entertainment, there is a direct correlation in my hearts ability to hear the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When people talk about TV shows, or actors, or movies, honest to God, <em>I don&#8217;t care</em> if I am not conversant or if I have no idea what you are talking about. Before the Lord, I want to rather fix my mind on things that will actually make me a meaningful person and will allow my heart to thrive.</p>
<p><strong>2. Resting, Relaxing, Sabbathing, and Saying No</strong></p>
<p>Continuing the theme of denying oneself, I have found that having adequate rest for my body and mind is of absolute importance in having my heart alive.</p>
<p><em>I am increasingly convinced that American culture does not know how to rest.</em> And we honestly break the Sabbath. Rest is a biblical mandate because when we honor our bodies we honor God.</p>
<p>The connection between my physical restedness and my spirit is intimate. <em>It is my belief that mind, body, heart, and spirit are all interconnected and if one suffers, they all suffer.</em></p>
<p>When I am working full-time, there is just so much beating the body and mind takes. I make it a priority to sleep 8-9 hours a night and to spend time with God in the mornings. The restedness allows me to make good decisions throughout the day and not fall asleep while praying.</p>
<p>To sustain that lifestyle means saying &#8220;no&#8221; to a lot of things. And that&#8217;s okay with me. I don&#8217;t care to be a weekend warrior. I don&#8217;t care to show people on Facebook how cool my life is. I know that I need rest and I will most likely continue to say &#8220;no&#8221; to hangouts, activities, birthday parties, dinners, etc so that I can be faithful with stewarding my heart and to be faithful with the few things God has entrusted me with.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s helped is not overloading my Saturdays. Last Saturday Esther and I spent the morning in long restful devotion before God. Our weekend was immensely blessed as a result of that! I want to continue living a life of balanced restedness.</p>
<p><strong>3. Saying YES to Intentional community of God-pursuers</strong></p>
<p>One of the things that Lord has taught me in the course of my life is <em>understanding the difference between your friends and your partners in life. </em></p>
<p>I consider partners to be weightier. These are the people who actually add to your life, who will <em>partner with you in your growth in the Lord</em>.</p>
<p>When working full-time, and being married, the amount of people that I can see and interact with is obviously much less. The lessening of time requires me to be strategic about my friendships and to really find partners in the Lord.</p>
<p>I intentionally invest in friendships that help me grow in my relationship with God.</p>
<p>For example there&#8217;s a couple at our church who my wife and I see as a valuable partnership and friendship. We had dinner together at a Mexican restaurant last weekend and it was amazing. All we talked about was how God was moving in our lives, ways we&#8217;re growing, how we&#8217;re being challenged, and difficulties we&#8217;re having. We prayed for each other at least 4 times that night, praying for healing, prophesying, and giving words of encouragement. It was so powerful. Oh, and we also had tons of fun playing and joking around too.</p>
<p>My point is that it&#8217;s easy to find friends to have fun with, to play, and to joke around. It is <em>not</em> easy to find friends who would do the former on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Continuing to invest in these friendships means life to me. And saying &#8220;no&#8221; to friendships that don&#8217;t is important as well.</p>
<p><strong>4. Finding Ways to Connect with God during Work</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m at work 8-9 hours a day. That&#8217;s a huge chunk of time. And spending time with God in the mornings and at night is not enough. I love that Chris Tomlin song as it reminds me what my relationship with God should be like, &#8220;<em>I need you Oh I need you,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Every hour</span> I need you.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I understand that not everyone&#8217;s work experience is like mine, but I kind of know the in&#8217;s and out&#8217; of my work where I know what I can do, when I can do it, and still have integrity in my work.  Here are some ways that helped me stay connected with God:</p>
<ul>
<li>For me to connect with God at work, I am constantly reading the Bible at my desk. It is just open, all the time. I want to eat continually.</li>
<li>During my breaks, I intentionally go outside, rest my body, and have rested prayer time with the Lord. I have a Kindle with my Bible on there, and I carry it with me everywhere to keep eating the Word.</li>
<li>During work, I try to stay away from ESPN (my crux..), and other mind-fogging inherently-addictive internet activities.</li>
<li>I try to have conversations about Jesus with my co-workers.</li>
<li>I constantly talk with Jesus during work. I process my emotions with him. I process what I&#8217;m feeling.</li>
<li>I have my intercession list at my desk all the time with situations, circumstances, and people I need to be praying for constantly. The act of intercession helps me hear how God feels.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Saying YES to Living a Life of Mission</strong></p>
<p>When asked about food Jesus responded to his disciples, &#8220;my food is to do the will of him who sent me.&#8221; Jesus&#8217; food is do God&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>This season God has been growing my ability to release God&#8217;s kingdom and to evangelize. I have been more passionate about being a witness for Jesus and spreading the fragrance of Jesus everywhere I go.</p>
<p>I have found that when I set my heart to obeying the Holy Spirit when he tells me to minister to someone, my heart grows alive. When I go to work with a mentality of not just &#8220;this is my job&#8221; but &#8220;this is my mission field,&#8221; there&#8217;s a grace that is released for me at work as I&#8217;m working there very purposefully to make Jesus known in my work place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten the opportunity to share my testimony here and there and to pray for a number of co-workers already. Those experiences make me hungry for more–hungry to see heaven invade earth in this dull work environment. I don&#8217;t care if I&#8217;m fired or let go, if I can leave this job one day having done the will of God, I will be satisfied.</p>
<p>I found that when I adapted this mentality about work and life in general, my heart is alive. My heart is alive because Jesus gives his presence to those who seek to build his kingdom. And he does that because you quite simply feel Jesus&#8217;s presence wherever Jesus is, and Jesus is always in the business of making disciples and expanding his kingdom in secret.</p>
<p>Setting my heart to living a life that minister to others is what replaces a lifestyle of entertainment and comfort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>So these are some ways that have been helping me be passionate while working full-time. I&#8217;m sure having kids will have it&#8217;s challenges one day&#8230;</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s my birthday today! While this blog is generally pretty serious stuff, here&#8217;s some random reflections on what year 26 was for me and some reflections moving forward.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>What Went Down When I Was 26</em></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Significant Life Events at 26:<br />
</strong>Getting engaged. Only to be eclipsed by getting married 6 months later. Yeah, those are pretty significant.</p>
<div id="attachment_6789" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6789 " alt="1149083_491689667587339_1074180486_o" src="http://phillipchan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1149083_491689667587339_1074180486_o-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" /><p class="wp-caption-text">My beautiful, awesome, godly, amazing, friendly, everything-I-could-ask-for wife Esther.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Favorite book read at 26:<br />
</strong><em>A Tale of Three Kings</em> by Edward Gene. A short, powerful book which served as a poignant reminder for me this year that the vicissitudes of life are often used by God to test our character and that we should despise the place of power else it should corrupt us like it did Saul.</p>
<div id="attachment_6780" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6780 " alt="221282" src="http://phillipchan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/221282-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Amazing book. Highly recommend.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Favorite New Friend at 26:<br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Probably Simeon Sham <a href="https://twitter.com/simeonsham" target="_blank">@simeonsham</a>. whose birthday was a week before mine. We have great conversations together, and he is really talented, humble, and anointed worship leader. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_6778" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6778 " alt="1907561_10152097757438251_474232179_n" src="http://phillipchan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1907561_10152097757438251_474232179_n-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">look how cute this guy is.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Favorite CD listened to at 26<br />
</strong>Hillsong United Young &amp; Free &#8211; Such a cool new worship sound</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://phillipchan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/yf-artwork-640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6792" alt="yf-artwork-640" src="http://phillipchan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/yf-artwork-640-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><em>Close Second</em>: Lecrae &#8211; Gravity A little old but I really enjoy this CD.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Favorite Wedding at 26<br />
</strong>I think I went to 8 weddings? Of all of them, my favorite was.. my own. (A little biased? Eh.. whatevs)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But outside of that, probably watching my best friend Justin Gottuso get married!</p>
<div id="attachment_6791" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6791 " alt="1009494_10103297695149405_932352192_o" src="http://phillipchan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1009494_10103297695149405_932352192_o-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Us praying for Justin and Ann for their marriage.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Biggest lesson God taught Me at 26<br />
</strong>I felt that the largest lesson God was growing in me was about my character. He put me in a low place at 26. In the hiddenness, and in the desert, my character was formed. He showed me how self-centered I was, how much selfish ambition I carried in my heart, how prideful and religious I was, and as he does with his beloved children, he humbled me so that I could grow in love. I feel that the life lessons learned at age 26 will carry me in my ministry for decades to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Biggest spiritual decision at 26<br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Probably joining Epicentre&#8217;s Discipleship school. I am so humbled by the experience.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Favorite Restaurant Eaten at 26<br />
</strong>I think this year I discovered how amazing <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boiling-crab-alhambra-2" target="_blank">Boiling Crab</a>. It&#8217;s basically cajun seafood. They sit you down, put a bib on you, line the table with paper, and plop a bag of seasoned seafood for you to eat with your hands. So delicious and fun. (Picture of Simeon eating it above).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Biggest Regret at 26</strong><br />
Man I made a lot of mistakes when I was 26. Said a lot of sorry&#8217;s. I feel like, as always, I can think of very specific times when I felt the Holy Spirit was telling me to do something but I didn&#8217;t for one reason or another. Walking away from those moments, I would replay in my head what could&#8217;ve divinely happened if I said yes. I carry those regrets in my heart to teach me to say &#8220;yes&#8221; if the Holy Spirit tells me to do something.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Favorite Purchase at 26</strong><br />
Sold my old laptop and computer for the 15in Macbook Pro Retina on Craigslist for a great price. Best. Computer. Ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>One God Story That Happened at 26 </strong><br />
One night I was hanging out with friends and saw this guy stumbling down the sidewalk with a (medical) boot. We decided to go up to him and pray for him and it turns out he was badly injured, in pain, and a bit drunk.  All 3 of us had powerful prayers for him and the Lord was touching him like crazy to the point of tears (this was a grown man). He said he felt no pain in his leg afterward! More importantly, he told us that his encounter with God literally changed his life at that moment as he was so down and out at that point. he was so thankful, still in awe of what happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A bit while later during dinner, he was so grateful, he snuck into our restaurant and payed for our entire meal. Yay to double blessings.</p>
<div id="attachment_6790" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6790 " alt="1404637_10100653019770141_1188854987_o" src="http://phillipchan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1404637_10100653019770141_1188854987_o-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#8217;s us at the restaurant.</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>What&#8217;s 27 Looking Like?</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">All right this is the part that gets pretty serious.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">More so than lately, I&#8217;ve been thinking about the end of my life. I have always said to myself and to others that we could always use a mid-life crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What is 27? It&#8217;s just a number. To some, that&#8217;s old, to others, that&#8217;s young. The truth is, <em>only God knows whether 27 is young or old for me.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What I mean is if God ordained 33 years for me to live, then 27 is really old. How old I will live to is in my Father&#8217;s hands. And what I do with my life is in my hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Moses&#8217; prayer in Psalm 90 is appropriate for every birthday: &#8220;Teach us to number our days <em>that we may gain a heart of wisdom.</em>&#8221; A heart of wisdom is one which knows the difference between unimportant things and important things, between momentary things and eternal things.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I want to spend my life investing in important and eternal things. The rage of the world is about getting people distracted with meaningless pursuits. May 27 be a year spent with death in mind, that my life would not be weighed as insignificant or wasted. This year, I pray the prayer of the martyr Jim Elliot who said, &#8220;I seek not a long life, but a full one, like you Lord Jesus.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And so let it be. Cheers to 27. And cheers to a God who is faithful to make us blameless every year till we see him.</p>

			<p>It is a human tendency to value talent and giftedness.</p>
<p>It is really natural to look at someone and go &#8220;Wow, he or she is really impressive!&#8221; It is equally tempting, in our human nature, to begin crowning giftedness. We can say things to these people like:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;You should be, like, in charge of things.&#8221; </em><br />
<em>&#8220;You should start your own x,y,z and promote yourself.&#8221;</em><br />
<em>&#8220;You should be promoted and display your talents!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>On the receiving side, talented people often suffer from thinking they can get ahead of life because of their talents. When humans value giftedness so much, who can blame them?</p>
<p>I have to admit, I think I&#8217;m pretty talented. And that&#8217;s something that people tell me pretty often–I can do a lot of things well. Surprisingly well (Do I write well? Eh&#8230;). And God knows all the things I do well and excel in.</p>
<p>In life, I run into a lot of talented people. <em>Amazingly</em> talented people. In fact, you could be one of those people reading now. And it is my prediction that with the pervasive growth of technology, the proliferation of information at our fingertips (quite literally), we may soon experience one of the most talented generations in human history.</p>
<p>Yet, the shocking thing is that the more I read the Bible the more I am knowing the heart of God. And what I&#8217;m realizing is that, <em><strong>despite what we think is really great about being talented or gifted, I don&#8217;t think God values giftedness very much at all.</strong></em></p>
<p>Allow me to explain what I mean.</p>
<p>The one passage that continually informs my understanding of the folly of giftedness is 1 Samuel 16:7. In this passage, Samuel is selecting a new king for Israel and makes the fatal mistake of thinking that God would choose the most physically impressive. God rebukes his prophet Samuel with one of the most amazing passages in the entire Bible. He says to Samuel:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Do not look at his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. </em><br />
<em>For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but the Lord looks on the heart.</span>&#8220;</em></p>
<p>What we find impressive about ourselves or other people, God is&#8230;not even looking at that.</p>
<p>While we as humans are impressed by people&#8217;s skills, their intelligence, their creativity, their great works of arts and achievement, their portfolio, their abilities, their athleticism, their innate qualities, etc, <em>God</em> is not impressed by <em>any</em> of those things. <strong>God is looking dead straight&#8230;at our hearts.</strong></p>
<p>He&#8217;s seeing what we&#8217;re made of on the inside. The human heart is what is valuable and beautiful to God.</p>
<p>What is valued by the God of the universe is how we are positioned before God. It&#8217;s about how we treat other people. It&#8217;s about how we deal with conflict. It&#8217;s how we parent our kids. It&#8217;s how we cherish our spouses. It&#8217;s about the moral purity of our ways. It&#8217;s about how we treat the poor and oppressed. It&#8217;s how we spend our time and our money. It&#8217;s how we respond to our enemies, to the people who annoy us, to the ones who don&#8217;t like. It&#8217;s about what we do with our pride. It&#8217;s how we respond to authority. It&#8217;s how cynical or offended we are. <em>It&#8217;s all about who we are when no one&#8217;s looking, when no one&#8217;s impressed, when no one cares. </em></p>
<p>Talent and giftedness are grossly overrated because they have been vastly outweighed by what God values more–<strong><em>our character.</em></strong></p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that Jesus never talks about talented people or gifted people? When he incarnated on earth, he spent no time with talented or great people. His affections were with lowly, poor, humble, and mistreated people, not promoted talented people.</p>
<p>Think also for a minute–Jesus is definitively the most talented human being in human history. He could have shown up and showed up every human being in history in every single category of human achievement. Hands down he could have. But He, in his humility, and in his conviction about what his Father valued, never flaunted his gifts. He did not flex his muscles of giftedness. He lived an opposite message.</p>
<p>He said that &#8220;whoever should be great, must be your servant.&#8221; In addition, he said that the great ones are those are exhibit humble child-likeness (Mt 18). The greatest people in Jesus&#8217; eyes are the humble, the meek, and the child-like.</p>
<p>The only time he does talk about talent is when he&#8217;s teaching the parable of the talents. In that parable, he makes no distinction between the one he gave five talents or ten talents. They both received the reward of hearing the Master say, &#8220;Well done, good and faithful servant.&#8221; His message was <em>faithfulness</em> with our talents, no matter how many we&#8217;ve been given is what moves God&#8217;s heart. Yet again, another challenge to our character.</p>
<p>Yes, it turns out that giftedness isn&#8217;t that great after all.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:6 talks about how all gifts, be it natural or spiritual, are given by God. And if they&#8217;re given by God, there&#8217;s no point in boasting or placing value on ourselves because of them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, gifts, according to the New Testament, are simply used to <em>serve</em> other people. It is to make <em>other</em> people great. In a world of rabid and diseased self-promotion, the Bible powerfully challenges us to use our giftedness, not for the fame for our own names, but to promote and serve other people. Amazing.</p>
<p>If you are indeed one of those very talented people (even if you are aren&#8217;t, this still applies to you!), perhaps we should put our talents in perspective with what&#8217;s important–our character before a holy God.</p>
<p><em>What good is it if you can sing brilliantly if you fail to love others? What good is it if you can rap and write poetry if you&#8217;re addicted to pornography and lust? What good is it if you&#8217;re the top dog at work when you lash out at your wife at home? What good is it if your works of art are publicized widely when you have uncontrollable rage? What good is it if you are super intelligent when you look down on others?</em></p>
<p>Over and over again, God has humbled me and has tried to make my giftedness second place to the quality of my heart. It is at this point that I humbly plead with you and at the same time joyfully invite all you talented people&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;partner with God to work on your character, and you will find that your talents and giftedness will be seated in the proper context. The proper context is a heart refined and designed for humble service towards others and life lived for a great God.</p>
<p>Talents? Gifts? <em>Lord, instead give me more a heart like yours.</em></p>
