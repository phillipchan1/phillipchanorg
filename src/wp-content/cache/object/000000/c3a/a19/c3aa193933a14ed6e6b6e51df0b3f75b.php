<p style="text-align: left;">A Black box is a device that records information during the flight of an aircraft. In that sense, this blog is a recording of the thoughts and events in my life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While I have my own personal private journal, I write on here so that those who read may be blessed, edified, encouraged, convicted, and as John the Apostle wrote, "that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name." I hope it will encourage believers in their pursuit of following and loving this Jesus.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was born and raised in Chicago. I grew up in a non-Christian family and gave my life to Christ at the end of 7th grade. I initially fell off the track a spiritually, but since high school, the Lord has started growing an unquenchable fire in my heart and I have never been the same since. I changed from a wild and crazy kid to a person who is wild and crazy about Jesus.</p>
Some more facts about me:
<ul>
	<li>My highest aim in life is to love Jesus with all my heart, mind, and soul.</li>
	<li>I am a student at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, CA</li>
	<li>God has called me to be a manifold Christian leader–preacher, a pastor, evangelist, healer, apostle, and a missionary-sending church planter</li>
	<li>I love basketball, playing guitar, leading worship, and enjoying a good meal.</li>
</ul>
